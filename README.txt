Monet
This code uses Google Inception neural network to identify the approximate year of paintings by
French Impressionist painter Claude Monet. The last layer of the neural network is replaced by
a layer of my own, where there are 6 labels, (1860, 1870, 1880, 1890, 1900, 1910).

Train.zip contains images of paintings by Monet. Each image is named based on the year of the painting.
Open Monet.py to run the code. Modify "model_dir" and "train_dir" to match the path that contains the training images.
